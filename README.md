### Hello World, I'm Isaac!
I am currently attending UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My current interest are in iOS development :iphone:, full stack development :computer: and computer science education 📚.

Outside of developing, I am a huge basketball fan (GO LAKERS 💜 💛). I'm also into gaming, watching youtube all night long, and listening to all types of music. 

Currently looking for iOS development opportunites that can enable me to use the tools I have learned into industry level work.

Go Bears! 🐻
